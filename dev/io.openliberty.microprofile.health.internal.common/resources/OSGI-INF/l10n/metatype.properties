The value is a number followed by an optional time unit of ms for milliseconds or s for seconds. If no time unit is specified, the value is in seconds by default. If the value is 0, 0s, 0ms or is empty, then the file-based health check function is disabled.

If no value is specified, the default value is 100 ms.
