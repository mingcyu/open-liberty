description=This feature has been stabilized. \
 The strategic alternative to this feature is to create a CDI Producer by following the technique as described in https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/02/19/mongodb-with-open-liberty.html \
 This feature enables connections to Cloudant databases \
 by providing a connector instance that's configured in the server configuration and can be injected \
 or accessed through Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). Applications use the \
 Cloudant client library to access the connector instance.
